    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size:large;">Slums are areas within a city or urban area that are characterized by a lack of basic infrastructure and services, poor living conditions, and often high levels of poverty. They are typically characterized by overcrowding, inadequate housing, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, poor quality of education and healthcare, and limited economic opportunities.
Slums can be found in both developed and developing countries, but they are more prevalent in developing countries, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. They are often the result of rapid urbanization and rural-to-urban migration, as people move from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities.
Living conditions in slums can be extremely challenging, with families often living in small, cramped spaces without access to basic necessities like electricity or running water. Lack of access to clean water and sanitation can also lead to the spread of disease, which can be difficult to control in densely populated areas.
Despite these challenges, many slum residents are resilient and resourceful, finding ways to make a living and support their families despite difficult circumstances. NGOs and other organizations are also working to improve conditions in slums, by providing access to basic services like water and sanitation, improving housing conditions, and supporting economic development.
However, slums remain a major challenge for many cities around the world, and addressing the root causes of slum formation is critical to creating more equitable and sustainable cities. This can include policies to promote affordable housing, create economic opportunities, and improve access to basic services for all residents, regardless of income or social status.</p>
